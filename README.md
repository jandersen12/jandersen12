## Welcome!

My name is Jordan, and I'm a student at the University of CA, Berkeley, currently pursuing my Masters in Information & Data Science.

💡 I’m currently learning about machine learning, data engineering, and statistical methods for data science.

🔍 I'm excited to dive deeper into Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Deep Learning, and Experiments & Causal Inference next semester!

🌎 I’m passionate about projects that leverage data science and machine learning for global social impact in areas such as: 
- Education & language learning 
- Climate change & sustainability 
- Humanitarian aid & crisis response
