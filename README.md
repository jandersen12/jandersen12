## [Sleepless Signals: Modeling the Impact of Health and Age on Sleep Duration](https://github.com/jandersen12/Health-Sleep-Regression)

This project seeks to describe the relationship between sleep, health and age by applying OLS Regression models to data from the Center for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factor Survey from 2022. In order to operationalize the data's interpretability and functionality, we categorized variables related to general health, physical health, mental health, age, and sleep duration. In addition to building and interpreting the regression models to quantify associations, we tested model assumptions such as multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, identical distribution and independence. While there was statistical significance in the relationships, the explanatory power of the model remained a low 3.7%, highlighting the complex nature of external influences on sleep duration.

## [Met Connect: A Graph Database Approach to Model the New York Met's Collection](https://github.com/jandersen12/Met-Objects-Graph-Model)

Utilizing open source data from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, our team converted the museum's object collection data into a graph database structure and used graph algorithms to uncover key insights that inform exhibition ideas, object curation, and user experience enhancements. We modeled the data in Neo4j and used Pagerank, Louvain Modularity, and Closeness Centrality algorithms. Finally, we developed exploratory plots and recommendations based on centrality scores and community detection.

## [Strategic Ad Auction Bidding Model](https://github.com/jandersen12/Strategic-Ad-Auction-Bidding)

Designed using object-oriented programming techniques in Python, this model optimizes second-price ad auction bidding strategies based on estimating user click probabilities. It implements three modular classes. In the user class, users are randomly assigned a click probability and determined ad engagement. The bidder class is where bids are adjusted based on expected utility, tracked balances, and by learning from previous outcomes. The auction class executeds the auction rounds and determines the winning bids.

## [A Global Analysis on Gender, Employment, and School Enrollment](https://github.com/jandersen12/World-Bank-Indicators-Analysis)

</a>

An exploratory data analysis project that uncovers relationships between gender, employment, and primary school enrollment at a global scale. By using Development Indicators and economic categorizations from the World Bank, my team discovered correlations between a country's female primary school enrollment rates and employment rates. By filtering and reshaping the data using melting in Python, we were able to analyze indicators for our chosen variables accross the years from 2017-2023, handling missing data with consistency and producing high-quality visualizations.

## [Partisan Perspectives: Testing Differences in Political Attitudes with R](https://github.com/jandersen12/Political-Party-Attitudes-Education)

<a href="https://github.com/jandersen12/Political-Party-Attitudes-Education">
  <img src="https://github.com/jandersen12/Political-Party-Attitudes-Education/blob/main/images/political-parties-image.jpg" width="200" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

This project aims to evaluate partisan differences in attitudes toward college professors and the importance of what is taught in public schools. It combines statistical testing with effect size estimation to ensure both scientific rigor and real-world interpretability. After cleaning and selecting relevant variables from the American National Election Survey (ANES) and ensuring test assumptions were met, we conducted Welch's t-test to evaluate feelings of warmth towards college professors, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to evaluate ratings of the importance of what is being taught in school. We implemented Cohen's D and Cliff's delta, respectively, to analyze the effect sizes of each hypothesis test.
