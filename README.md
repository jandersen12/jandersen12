This project seeks to describe the relationship between sleep, health and age by applying OLS Regression models to data from the Center for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factor Survey from 2022. In order to operationalize the data's interpretability and functionality, we categorized variables related to general health, physical health, mental health, age, and sleep duration. In addition to building and interpreting the regression models to quantify associations, we tested model assumptions such as multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, identical distribution and independence. While there was statistical significance in the relationships, the explanatory power of the model remained a low 3.7%, highlighting the complex nature of external influences on sleep duration.

An exploratory data analysis project that uncovers relationships between gender, employment, and primary school enrollment at a global scale. By using Development Indicators and economic categorizations from the World Bank, my team discovered correlations between a country's female primary school enrollment rates and employment rates. By filtering and reshaping the data using melting in Python, we were able to analyze indicators for our chosen variables accross the years from 2017-2023, handling missing data with consistency and producing high-quality visualizations.
