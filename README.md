Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes-related eye disease that damages the blood vessels in the retina, potentially leading to vision loss or blindness. This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retina images captured through fundus photography under diverse imaging conditions. To enhance the model's generalization and minimize overfitting, the approach incorporates image transformation and data augmentation techniques, enabling the system to perform robustly across a wide range of visual inputs.

## [Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Language Endangerment Status](https://github.com/jandersen12/Machine-Learning-Endangered-Languages)

Language endangerment threatens cultural diversity, with over 40% of the world‚Äôs 7,000 languages at risk of disappearing. As these languages vanish, so do the unique histories, identities, and perspectives they embody, often from marginalized groups. This project aims to predict a language‚Äôs endangerment level, from extinct to not endangered, using features such as speaker counts, political status, and urbanization and internet usage rates in the countries where it is spoken. By applying multiple predictive models, we seek to identify the key factors driving language decline and enable earlier, targeted preservation efforts.

## [A Causal Experimental Study on Product Personalization and Bundling](https://github.com/jandersen12/Causal-Experiment-Product-Marketing.git)

In digital commerce, personalization and product bundling are widely used strategies aimed at increasing consumer engagement and spending. This study investigates whether identity-based personalization enhances the effectiveness of product bundling in driving purchase behavior. By using a 3x2 factorial design, users are assigned to one of six simulated purchase environments. By offering a maximum $300 prize, we attempt to motivate participants to treat the simulation as close to reality as possible. Our hypothesis states that bundling and personalization will individually increase intent to purchase amounts, while the combination of both will also result in higher purchase amounts.

## [Met Connect: A Graph Database Approach to Model the New York Met's Collection](https://github.com/jandersen12/Met-Objects-Graph-Model)

Utilizing open source data from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, our team converted the museum's object collection data into a graph database structure and used graph algorithms to uncover key insights that inform exhibition ideas, object curation, and user experience enhancements. We modeled the data in Neo4j and used Pagerank, Louvain Modularity, and Closeness Centrality algorithms. Finally, we developed exploratory plots and recommendations based on centrality scores and community detection.

## [A Global Analysis on Gender, Employment, and School Enrollment](https://github.com/jandersen12/World-Bank-Indicators-Analysis)

</a>

An exploratory data analysis project that uncovers relationships between gender, employment, and primary school enrollment at a global scale. By using Development Indicators and economic categorizations from the World Bank, my team discovered correlations between a country's female primary school enrollment rates and employment rates. By filtering and reshaping the data using melting in Python, we were able to analyze indicators for our chosen variables accross the years from 2017-2023, handling missing data with consistency and producing high-quality visualizations.

## [Partisan Perspectives: Testing Differences in Political Attitudes with R](https://github.com/jandersen12/Political-Party-Attitudes-Education)

<a href="https://github.com/jandersen12/Political-Party-Attitudes-Education">
  <img src="https://github.com/jandersen12/Political-Party-Attitudes-Education/blob/main/images/political-parties-image.jpg" width="200" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

This project aims to evaluate partisan differences in attitudes toward college professors and the importance of what is taught in public schools. It combines statistical testing with effect size estimation to ensure both scientific rigor and real-world interpretability. After cleaning and selecting relevant variables from the American National Election Survey (ANES) and ensuring test assumptions were met, we conducted Welch's t-test to evaluate feelings of warmth towards college professors, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to evaluate ratings of the importance of what is being taught in school. We implemented Cohen's D and Cliff's delta, respectively, to analyze the effect sizes of each hypothesis test.
