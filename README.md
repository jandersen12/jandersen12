## Welcome!

My name is Jordan, and I'm a student at the University of CA, Berkeley, where I am pursuing my Masters of Information & Data Science.

💡 Currently learning about data engineering and statistics, including linear regression and modeling.

💻 Excited to dive deeper into Machine Learning and Experiments & Causal Inference next semester!

🔍 I’m seeking opportunities to work with large datasets, build scalable data pipelines, and contribute to cross-functional projects that uncover patterns, tell stories through data, and drive meaningful insights.

🌎 Passionate about projects that leverage data science and machine learning for global social impact in areas such as: 
  - Healthcare 
  - Education & language learning
  - Climate change & sustainability 
  - Humanitarian aid & crisis response
